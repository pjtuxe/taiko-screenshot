> This product allows you to take a screenshot of any given size, resolution or extension of the specified page by issuing a simple command.

Taiko Screenshot (later only TSS) is a dead-simple wrapper application that allows you to take a screenshot of any website. The core program is basically based on Taiko, and the application is a Docker shortcut around the library. 

## Requirements

The following dependencies need to be installed to start the project:

- Docker Engine 19.03 or later

The following dependencies are only needed if you want to further develop the library:

- Node 12 or later
- npm 6 or later

## Installation

This section contains important information about the installation process. The Standard Installation section contains basic user information, the Build a custom image section may be more useful for developers.

### Standard installation

Basically the library can be run by issuing a simple command, as the deployed artifact can already be found in the Docker Hub.

The latest image is available at the following link: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot 

The image file can be obtained by issuing the following command:

```bash
$ docker pull pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot
```

### Build a custom image

If you want to build a Docker image file in a local environment and improve it, you can do so using the following commands.

1. First, clone the repository to a directory on your computer:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot.git
   $ cd taiko-screenshot
   ```
   
2. Install the application dependencies through:

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Delete existing Docker Taiko images if any:

   ```bash
   $ docker images rm pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot
   ```
   
4. Build a new image file using the Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   $ docker build -t pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot .
   // or
   $ npm run docker:build
   ```

5. Follow the instructions in "Usage" to use it. Keep in mind that Docker caches should be ignored when recompiling using the `--no-cache` parameter.

## Usage

The screenshot can be taken by issuing a very simple command:

```bash
$ docker run -it -e TSS_URL=https://google.com -v $(pwd):/storage pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot
```

This is the command with the fewest parameters to successfully run a Taiko Screenshot session. In addition, various environment variables can be used, which will be expanded in the "Configuration" section.

Letâ€™s break this command down into more details and examine exactly what is needed:

- `docker run -it`: this command allows us to run a specific command in a new Docker container
- `-e TSS_URL=...`: this variable tells you which page you want to screenshot
- `-v $(pwd):/storage`: this is necessary for the downloaded image to transfer from the container to the host machine (the created image will basically be placed here)
- `pjtuxe/taiko-screenshot` the name of the downloaded / compiled image

## Configuration

The application can be easily configured with the help of some environment variables, which are described below:

| Name          | Value          | Required | Default        | Description                                                                                         |
|---------------|----------------|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TSS_URL       | String         | Yes      | -              | URL of the page to be saved                                                                         |
| TSS_NAME      | String         | No       | screenshot.png | To save screenshots to a custom location you can use this environment variable                      |
| TSS_FULL_PAGE | Boolean        | No       | true           | You can use the fullPage option to take a screenshot of the entire page                             |
| TSS_ENCODING  | Enum("base64") | No       | null           | Taiko's screenshot API can also return images in base64 encoding format                             |
| TSS_WAIT      | Number         | No       | null           | The main thread will wait that many milliseconds between loading the page and taking the screenshot |
